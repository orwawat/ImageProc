Q1: What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try to control on?

A: Each level of the Laplacian pyramid is a different band of frequencies from the original image.
    The base level (same resolution like the original image) is the highest frequencies, then lower frequencies and
    so on. The tip of the pyramid (lowest resolution image) is the lowest frequencies
    (and in fact equal to the tip of the gaussian pyramid). Hence, each level is a band ('doughnut' of frequencies)
    By adding the coefficient vector, we control the mixture rate between frequencies. having more weight in the high
    frequencies will result in sharpening (while might increase the noise with it), while more weight on lower
    frequencies will blur the resulting image.
