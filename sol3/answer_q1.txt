Q1: What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try to control on?

A: Each level of the Laplacian pyramid is a different band of frequencies from the original image.
    The base level (same resolution like the original image) is the highest frequencies, then lower frequencies and
    so on. The tip of the pyramid is the lowest frequencies. By adding the coefficient vector, we control the mixture
    rate between frequencies. having more weight in the high frequencies will result in sharpening, while ore weight
    on lower frequencies will blur the resulting image.
