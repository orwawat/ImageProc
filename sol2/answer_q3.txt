Q3: What is the difference between the two results (Blurring in image space and blurring in Fourier space)?

A: Usually, the main difference is how the convolution treats the image boundaries as opposed to how they are treated
    in the freq. domain. In the spatial domain, we usually replicate, mirror or pad with 0's when reaching the
    boundaries. In the frequency domain however, everything is treated in a cyclic manner. Thus, when blurring the
    edge of the image we actually replace it with a weighted mean of the neighbors, which include the edge on the other
    side of the image.

    Since in this exercise we were told that we can treat the boundaries however we prefer, I used the option 'wrap'
    (in the spatial domain convolution) so that it treats the image in a cyclic manner, and the results between the
    two blurs are the same.
