Q2: What happens if the center of the gaussian (in the space domain) will not be at the
    (0,0) of the image? Why does it happen?

A: If the gaussian's center will not be properly positioned at the 0,0 of the image in the spatial case, we will get
    The blurred image only broken up to 4 equal sized rectangles, and ordered in the wrong fashion.

    This happens due to the convolution theorem. In the theorem it is stated that convolution in the spatial case is
    equal to a point-wise multiplication in the frequency domain. since the kernel and the image are of different sizes,
    we pad the kernel with 0's. Now, when we convolve we treat the center of the gaussian as its 0,0 but for the DFT,
    its 0,0 is located in the top left corner. SO, when it gets transformed and multiplied, its as if we start the
    blurring process from the middle of the image, and work our way down and right. since the freq. domain is cyclic,
    we still get all the other parts of teh image, only ordered wrong.
