The quantization procedure needs an initial segment division of [0..255] to segments, z. If a division
will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash (Q1: Why?) - when we find q (specifically here -
 when we find the first q), we find the weighted average of each segment. I.e, we divide by the number of pixel in the
 segment to normalize. since one of the segments have no pixel in it, we in fact divide by 0,
 causing our process to crash
