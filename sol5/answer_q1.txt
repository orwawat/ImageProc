Q1: suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that
could be used for super-resolution.

A: In order to use the workflow we used here to train the network to create super resolution images,
we need to train it to sharpen expanded images. As opposed to previously learned methods for sharpening which deals
with specific aspects of the blurred-expanded-image (usually by fabricating the missing high frequencies), the nn has
the potential to learn how 'natural' images should look, and complete this task in a better manner.
What I did to make it happen is create a corruption image which reduces the image to half it size (as in the pyramid
blending ex), and then re-expand it, thus getting an expanded image. The workflow stayed the same, each image was
reduced and expanded, random patches has been cropped and the nn learned how to restore the patches.
I used 48 channels with patches of (32,32).
Finally, to use the image to actually restore a full image, I used the conv-trick. Upon receiving an image,
I expanded it, and then let the nn restore it.
